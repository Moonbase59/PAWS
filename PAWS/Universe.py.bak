  This library supplies the basic "laws of nature" for the PAWS engine. It
  provides the basic functionality a game author expects. This is the layer
  most people will think of when they think of PAWS.

#                                 Style Guidelines
#
C="""
  To organize PAWS all the files share the same design conventions. The
  files have been organized into sections to make it easier to navigate
  through them with a text editor.

  The major sections are marked by boxes with borders made of ******'s that
  stretch across the entire page. If you search for #*** you can jump from
  section to section. The sections provide an overview of the entire file.

  Within each section you'll find a set of related classes, objects, and
  functions. If you use the Notepad++ text editor, the Alt-0 keystroke will
  fold the file into its smallest, most easily navigated form. Clicking a +
  to the left of a folded section will allow you to unfold only that
  section. Thus you can keep most of the file folded, seeing only the part
  you're actually interested in. This helps tremendously.

  COLOR CODES

  This source code is best read with a color coding editor, preferably
  Notepad++ using 18 point Lucinda Console font, in 1280x1024 resolution
  (large fonts).

  The following colors were used:

  Grey          - Comments (italics)
  Orange        - Quoted Text (bold)
  Bright Blue   - Python and PAWS keywords (bold)
  Green         - Local Variables (bold)
  Purple        - Operators, parentheses, etc.
  Red           - Numbers

  James Cunningham Fixes to TerminalFrame that allowed it to work in OS X
                   and Linux as well. Speed enhancements to Say() that work
                   in all 3 OSs but are particulary helpful in OS X. Also
                   solved the scrolling issue on all 3 OSs.

  Greg @ R.A.I.F   Suggestion that allowed binary pickling to work, enabling
                   the Save Game file to be somewhat obfuscated, reducing
                   player cheating.

  Matthias C. Hormann   Lots of bug fixes, spelling corrections, conversion
                        to all unicode, added some extra functionality.

#                            Import needed Modules
#
C="""
  By importing (a reference) to everything in PAWS.py we gain two benefits.
  First, we can refer to *anything* in the PAWS module without putting
  "PAWS." in front of it. For example instead of saying PAWS.Engine we can
  just say Engine.

  Second, we don't have to perform any imports for the standard modules PAWS
  already imported, which is convenient. Keep in mind, when it comes to
  programming *LAZY IS GOOD*. In this case we save memory by not having 2
  copies of the same thing, and we also save on typing!

# similar in nature to the functions in the PAWS file, your game can use both.

def Agree(Verb, Subject=None, Contract=FALSE):
    """
    Returns proper verb to agree with subject, allows contraction.

    The arguments of the Agree() function are:

    Verb:     This is the verb whose format is to be decided.

    Subject:  This is the Actor whose "you/he/she/they" status the verb
              should agree with.  If none is given, the verb will agree
              with the status of the current player.

    Contract: if true, Agree() will return a contracted form of the verbs
              "be" or "have".  Contract has no effect on other verbs.

    Some examples of use:

    "{You()} {Agree('put')} the coin into the slot."

    "{Fred.FormatYou} {Agree('be',Fred)}n't going anywhere without {Fred.FormatYour} security blanket."

  A SERVICE is just a "mini" class used to add abilities to the base
  classes. For example, an actor by themselves isn't much use. But add a
  combat service and you have a monster. Add a Patrol service and you have
  a wandering monster.

  Take a room and add a Patrol service and you have a moving room! Services
  are carefully designed so any service can be used with any class.

  Note services never inherit from a base class, they *are* base classes.
  """

class ServiceActivation:
    """
    This service allows devices to be activated and deactivated. This is
    generally used for light sources but can be used for any device that
    is switched on or off, with or without a tool.

        This service is particularly involved, having lots of possible
        complaints and options. Therefore each property below gets its own
        lengthy explanation. Note this service is designed primarily for
        lightsources (like flashlights, torches, candles, etc) but can
        easily accomodate any device with a simple on/off function just by
        changing the wording of the various properties.

        # (CantLookInside, CantLookBehind, CantLookOn or CantLookUnder). The
        # first step is to call self.VerbPreposition() and place the result in
        # Attr. This method will either return the current verb's
        # ExpectedPreposition property or "inside" if the current verb doesn't
        # have an ExpectedPreposition property.
        #
        # self.VerbPreposition() is just a "shorthand" method. If you look at
        # the method you'll see it's really just two lines of
        # code. However, because we call it in lots of different places it's
        # easier and less confusing to make a method call rather than repeat
        # those two lines of code each time.
        #
        # Another advantage of using a method here instead of the actual code is
        # called ABSTRACTION. Abstraction allows us to put the details of
        # getting the verb's preposition in one place instead of several places.
        # If we later change our minds about how to get the verb's preposition
        # (perhaps adding additional code) we only have to do it one place
        # instead of half a dozen! This is a cornerstone of good programming
        # design. It saves you time, effort, and eliminates a particularly
        # frustrating kind of bug, caused by forgetting to change the code in
        # one place when you've changed it everywhere else.

        This method returns the outermost room that holds this object. It
        does so by looping through each parent object until a None location
        is returned, at which point we know we've reached the outermost
        room.

        The heart of the routine is the while loop. Let's take this example.
        Suppose we have the player carrying rock in a box in a forest.
        Obviously, Me.ParentRoom(), Box.ParentRoom(), and Rock.ParentRoom()
        should all return Forest, but how?

        Let's take the rock as our example. We start off by setting the
        variable Object to Rock.

        Each time we hit the loop we have to test Object.Location to see if
        it has one. Rock does, so we set the object to the rock's location
        which is Box. Remember, the Location property holds the object that
        contains this object.

        The second time through the loop Object.Location is Forest, so we
        set Object to Forest.

        This time, however, Forest.Location is None, so we ignore the loop
        and return Object (Forest) as our parent room.

        Basicly, locations form a "tree" that you can follow back to the
        root. The root will always be a room for all objects that exist in
        the game's "physical" universe. You can play games by setting an
        object's location to None, which effectively removes the object
        from existance (along with all contents). You should be very careful
        doing so, however.

        description provided as part of a room.

        For instance, the rock is described as "a small grey rock" in
        general, or "There is a small rock here." when described as part of
        the room's contents. But when looked at closely it might say "The
        rock is oblong, rough, and about the right size to fit comfortably
        in your hand."

        In a room, the LDesc is the room's visual description.

        By default the long description isn't very helpful. Notice we use
        NamePhrase instead of SDesc.

  The default map is used when a room's map doesn't contain a given
  direction. For example, when North is undefined in the room map then North
  is searched for in the default map.

  The default map is intended to reduce the game author's work load. You can
  define a class that changes the default map to have all eight horizontal
  directions say "There is a wall there." instead of "You can't go that
  way."

  The default map primarily allows a way for you to set up a default error
  message for a given direction, without having to fill each room's map over
  and over again.

  Notice we add this property to the global object.

C="""
  Like the directions defined just before ClassRoom, and the verbs defined
  immediately above, the following lines define *objects*. Game, for
  example, holds the actual game data like your name, copyright, etc.

  Universe uses these objects directly to impact your game. And while your
  game may replace these objects, they are still fully functional and you
  could write a game using them.
  """
#--- Game Object

C="""
  The game object is pretty simple, really. It's used at the beginning of
  the game to print the banner, the introduction, and supply a bit of
  information. Other than that, it doesn't do anything.
  """

Game = ClassGameObject()

#--- Player Object

C="""
  The player object is absolutely critical. It is the represenation of the
  player in the game, literally the eyes and ears of the player. Note we
  record the player object in Global, so it can be accessed by the Core file
  and your game file.
  """

UniverseMe = ClassPlayer(u"me,myself")
Global.Player = UniverseMe

#--- The Ground

C="""
  Whenever the player says something like "examine floor" or "examine
  ground" this object will use the current actor's location's GroundDesc()
  property instead. If Take or Taste is used then these descriptions are
  used, otherwise the default descriptions assigned to BasicThing are used.

  Note if you want a special Ground object for certain rooms you can set the
  HasGround property to FALSE, then create (another) ground object (maybe
  MyGround or something) with a new Landmark property set to TRUE. That way
  you can implement all the sensory methods for your MyGround object.

  The landmark property is "HasGround".
  """

Ground = ClassLandmark(u"ground,floor")
Ground.Landmark = u"Ground"

Ground.SetDesc(u"L", u"{P.CA().Where().GroundDesc()}")
Ground.SetDesc(u"Take", u"You must be joking.")
Ground.SetDesc(u"Taste", u"No!")
Ground.SetDesc(u"Feel", u"It feels like ordinary ground to {Me()}.")

#--- No Wall

C="""
  Whenever HasWall is FALSE, this object will appear.
  """

NoWall = ClassLandmarkMissing(u"wall")
NoWall.Landmark = u"Wall"
NoWall.NamePhrase = u"Non-Existent Wall"

NoWall.SetDesc(u"L", u"There’s no wall here.")
NoWall.SetDesc(u"Take", u"You can’t take what doesn’t exist.")
NoWall.SetDesc(u"Taste", u"How exactly do you taste something that doesn’t exist?")
NoWall.SetDesc(u"Sound", u"The (non-existent) wall makes no (non-existant) noise.")
NoWall.SetDesc(u"Odor", u"The (non-existent) wall has no odor. Hardly surprising, really.")

#--- Space Time

C="""
  Because of the way the code works Rooms have to be "somewhere", ie all
  rooms have to be contained in something. That something is SpaceTime, an
  otherwise unused object that is never referred to by the game to the
  player, and can't be referred to by the player. Notice that we
  DELIBERATELY used propercase in defining SpaceTime's noun? That means the
  parser will always ignore it, the parser is looking only for things in
  lower case.
  """

SpaceTime = ClassBasicThing(u"SpaceTime")
SpaceTime.IsLit = TRUE

#--- The Sky

C="""
  Whenever the player says something like "examine sky" or "examine ceiling"
  this object will use the current actor's location's SkyDesc() property
  instead.

  Note if you want a special Sky object for certain rooms you can set the
  HasSky property to FALSE, then create (another) sky object (maybe MySky or
  something) with a new Landmark property set to TRUE. That way you can
  implement all the sensory methods for your MySky object.
  """

Sky = ClassLandmark(u"sky,ceiling,air", u"thin")
Sky.Landmark = u"Sky"

Sky.SetDesc(u"L", u"{P.CA().Where().SkyDesc()}")
Sky.SetDesc(u"Feel", u"""
                   {SCase(You())} wave your hand vaguely in front of {You()}.
                   There. Satisfied?
                   """)
Sky.SetDesc(u"Take", u"You must be joking.")
Sky.SetDesc(u"Taste", u"Very poetic, but extremely impractical.")
Sky.SetDesc(u"Sound", u"{P.CA().Where().SoundDesc()}")
Sky.SetDesc(u"Odor", u"{P.CA().Where().OdorDesc()}")

#--- Wall

C="""
  Whenever the player says something like "examine wall" this object will
  use the current actor's location's WallDesc() property instead.

  Note if you want a special Wall object for certain rooms you can set the
  HasWall property to FALSE, then create (another) Wall object (maybe MyWall
  or something) with a new Landmark property set to TRUE. That way you can
  implement all the sensory methods for your MyWall object.
  """

Wall = ClassLandmark(u"wall")
Wall.Landmark = u"Wall"

Wall.SetDesc(u"L", u"{P.CA().Where().WallDesc()}")
Wall.SetDesc(u"Take", u"You must be joking.")
