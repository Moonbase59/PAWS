  This module contains the constants and classes required to create the Core
  of the PAWS runtime system. This includes the game engine, parser, global
  variables, and *very* basic "thing" object and verb object.

  It assumes some sort of library will be layered on top of it before games
  are developed. By default this library is Universe.

  To organize PAWS all the files share the same design conventions. The
  files have been organized into sections to make it easier to navigate
  through them with a text editor.

  The major sections are marked by boxes with borders made of ******'s that
  stretch across the entire page. If you search for #*** you can jump from
  section to section. The sections provide an overview of the entire file.

  Within each section you'll find a set of related classes, objects, and
  functions. If you use the Notepad++ text editor, the Alt-0 keystroke will
  fold the file into its smallest, most easily navigated form. Clicking a +
  to the left of a folded section will allow you to unfold only that
  section. Thus you can keep most of the file folded, seeing only the part
  you're actually interested in. This helps tremendously.

  COLOR CODES

  This source code is best read with a color coding editor, preferably
  Notepad++ using 18 point Lucinda Console font, in 1280x1024 resolution

  The following colors were used:

  Grey          - Comments (italics)
  Orange        - Quoted Text (bold)
  Bright Blue   - Python and PAWS keywords (bold)
  Green         - Local Variables (bold)

  player and processing commands.

  FINISHED means the player is quitting the game. Any command that sets the

    #

    # in PAWS a class may have only one base class, along with service classes.
    # A service class by definition has no ancestors (Python's base object
    # isn't counted). Thus we really only follow one chain down. For instance,
    # in Thief's Quest the ClassTQRoom class is composed of
    # ServiceDictDescription (a service class) and ClassRoom (a base class).
    #
    # Thus in theory ClassTuple contains two classes, ServiceDictDescription

def AppendDictList(Dict,Key,Value):

    Appends value to a list dictionary

    This routine doesn't return a value, it appends a value to a dictionary
    of lists. A Dictionary List is just a dictionary who's values are
    actually lists. For example, the VerbsDict is a list dictionary, it
    might look like this:

    {'look': [LookVerb, LookIntoVerb, LookThroughVerb],
     'quit': [QuitVerb],
     'exit': [QuitVeb]}

    You supply the dictionary name, the key, and the value you want to
    append. The key must be a string, either a single value (without any
    commas) or multiple values seperated by commas. For instance:

    AppendDictList(NounsDict,"rock,stone",SmallRock)

    This would place SmallRock in the dictionary under two keys,
    "rock", and "stone".

    # We have to massage the key to make it easier to work with. The
    # first thing we do is force the key strings to lower case
    # (string.lower), then split the comma delimited string into a
    # list of strings (string.split).
    #
    # Since this function is mainly used to add words to the verb, noun,
    # preposition and adjective dictionaries. We want to make sure
    # the developer doesn't have to worry about case sensitivity when
    # defining verbs and objects.

        # to the entry. This has the effect of adding Value to the
        # list of values already filed under the key.
        #
        # If the word ISN'T in the dictionary, we add the LIST of Value
        # to the dictionary. Notice how the Value is surrounded by
        # square brackets?
        #
        # This is a 'casting' trick. It forces value (which is generally
        # one item) to become a list of one item. This is important
        # because append only works with a list. If we didn't convert
        # Value to a list the second object added to the same key value

def DisambiguateListOfLists(ListOfLists,TestMethod,ErrorMethod,Actor=None):
    """
    Break list of lists into multiple lists for DisambiguateList() function

    This function performs "disambiguation" of the kinds of object lists
    created by the parser. In other words, it intelligently chooses which
    objects are intended when there's a choice.

    For instance, if the game contains three keys, a bone key, a brass key,
    and a silver key but only one rock and the player says "get key and
    rock" the resulting direct object list looks like:

    [ [BoneKey,BrassKey,SilverKey], [Rock] ]

    Notice the direct object list contains two other lists! Key could refer
    to any of the keys, at the time of parsing there's no way to know which
    is intended. Thus we say the key is ambiguous.

    Rock isn't of course, since there's only one rock in the game.

    The theory of disambiguation is complex and messy, so pay close
    attention. There are three major problems we have to deal with.

    First, we're starting off with  a list of lists. It's messy, but the
    only way we can handle ambiguous objects.

    The second problem is that of delegation. Since the PAWS engine is
    intended to be library independent we have to build an engine that can
    work with anyone's library. This means both the test method(s) and the
    error method(s) are supplied by the library, along with the specific
    disambiguation method itself.

    Which leads to our third problem. We have no way of predicting ahead of
    time which tests the library author will want to perform, or how many of
    them there will be. The implication is we have to be able to handle
    multiple disambiguation passes.

    There's another implication. If we handle multiple passes, then at some
    point part of the list will be single objects and part of the list will
    be lists!

    For example, let's say that there are two passes. The first tests to see
    if the objects are known. (Assume the player doesn't know a silver key
    exists in the game).

    The first pass yields: [ Rock, [BoneKey,BrassKey] ]

    Notice Rock is no longer a list, it's a single object. That's because
    the aim of disambiguation is to reduce our list of lists to a simple
    list of objects, if possible. Since the [Rock] list contains only one
    item we convert it to an object. We've eliminated the silver key, but
    key is still ambiguous.

    Second pass, are the items reachable? The bone key is in the basement,
    but both the rock and the brass key are in the kitchen with the player.

    Thus our second pass yeilds: [ Rock, BrassKey ] and our disambiguation
    is done.

    BUT there's a third pass, are all objects visible? Our third pass
    doesn't eliminate anything and yields: [ Rock, BrassKey ].

    And depending on the library you use there might be more passes yet. So
    we have to be able to handle all three states of the list.

        #===================
        # Break Down Command
        #===================

        # English is a difficult language to parse. Fortunately, all we have
        # to parse are commands, which, while difficult, always follow a
        # consistant format.
        #
        # The format is:
        #
        # [Actor] VERB [direct object(s)] [preposition] [indirect object(s)]
        #
        # (We're going to ignore the inconvenient form "VERB [direct objects]
        # [Actor]" since it's too difficult to handle cleanly and most
        # people use the first form anyway …)
        #
        # All items in square brackets are optional, which means the only
        # item required in the command is a verb!
        #
        # This suggests the strategy the parser uses to break down the
        # command. First it scans the command for a verb. If it doesn't find
        # a verb, there's nothing more to be done, we complain and return
        # a FAILURE.
        #
        # Assuming we find a verb we save its location. The next thing we do
        # is try and find one or more prepositions, saving the location of
        # the first one we find.
        #
        # The locations of the verb and first preposition are landmarks in
        # the command.
        #
        # Consider the command: "John, dig the hole with the shovel." Since
        # "John" preceeds the verb, we know that John must be the actor,
        # you can't put anything else in front of a verb.
        #
        # Likewise we know "with" is a preposition. Therefore "the hole" is
        # a direct object.
        #
        # And "the shovel" is the indirect object. Translate those
        # (see below) and the parser's job is finished.
        #
        # There's one special case we need to look at. That's a command
        # where the preposition immediately follows the verb, which makes
        # the command's indirect object into the direct object.
        #
        # For example: "Look into chest"
        #
        # Left to itself, chest would become the command's indirect object.
        # However, all we have to do when the first preposition immediately
        # follows the verb is copy the indirect object list into the
        # direct object list and then zap the indirect object list.

        #----------
